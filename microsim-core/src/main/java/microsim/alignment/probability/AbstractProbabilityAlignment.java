 * Binary alignment methods. Acknowledgements: Partly based on
 * "Evaluating Binary Alignment Methods in Microsimulation Models", by Jinjing

 * General principle of operation of this class: a) Some variable is defined for
 * the agents (the variable can be a probability or an outcome). b) Alignment is
 * called to modify that variable, possibly making use of a specific process of
 * the agents.
 * 
 * Hence: 1) ALIGNMENT OF PROBABILITIES: this requires a process is specified
 * that computes individual probabilities of the occurrence of a given event.
 * Alignment is then called to modify those probabilities. A second process is
 * specified to determine the occurrence of the event given the (modified)
 * probabilities. INPUTS: agentList: the list of agents; variableName: the name
 * of the variable containing the probability of the event; targetShare or
 * targetNumber: the share or number of positive outcomes in the population to
 * be aligned, to be used as target; method: the alignment method to be used.
 * 
 * 2) ALIGNMENT OF OUTCOMES: this requires a single process is specified that
 * computes the probability of an event and the determines its occurrence.
 * INPUTS: agentList: the list of agents; variableName: the name of the variable
 * containing the probability of the event; process: the name of the process to
 * be used by the alignment method to modify the variable at the individual
 * level; targetShare or targetNumber: the share or number of positive outcomes
 * in the population to be aligned, to be used as target; method: the alignment
 * method to be used.
